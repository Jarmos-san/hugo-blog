This repository hosts the tools, assets & themes for my [personal website][Personal Website]. The site is statically generated with [Hugo][Hugo Landing Page] & the [PaperMod][Hugo-PaperMod] theme. Hugo which is a Static Site Generator(SSG) built with [Golang][Go Landing Page] generates the static contents for the site to be deployed to [Netlify][Netlify Landing Page].

## :checkered_flag: Getting Started

Did you find my website somehow either on GitHub or elsewhere on the Internet? Do you want a site similar to mine for yourself too? Or perhaps, you just ❤️ open-source software & would like to make a contribution to my site, then read this [README](/README.md) should be your first step.

A bird's eye overview of what the blog is capable of:

- It's FREE, as in no server costs are involved (_for now_).
- In context to the point above, there's no server in the first place to serve the website on the Internet. All the generated static content are delivered over [Netlify's CDN][Netlify CDN Guide].
- Transparency is a major aspect in everything I do in life. The same applies to my personal website as well. That said, I try to keep stuff related to it as open-source as possible on this repository. In other words, my website will forever be open-sourced.
- My site uses [Cloudflare Analytics][Cloudflare Analytics] along with Google Analytics (GA) for the following reasons:
  - Cloudflare is more privacy driven & hence is suitable for some of my more privacy-concerned audiences.
  - I would love to use [Matomo][Matomo] over GA but it requires me to rent out a VPS. I just don't have the financial overhead to increase my expenses at the moment. So, as much as I want to protect my user's privacy, it's just not a possibility right now. Although, I appreciate every bit of a [donation][Buy Me a Coffee] that will help me setup & maintain a Matomo Analytics server to protect your privacy.
  - Cloudflare Analytics is still in beta & doesn't offer as many metrics as GA provides. Much of the metrics I need, is important for me to keep improving the services I provide on my site & to my sponsors.
- Knowledge-sharing over aesthetics. Visit my site & you'll find it's pretty simple & minimalist. That's intentional as I want my audiences to read my content & take home some valuable lessons. Intrusive popups & marketing gimmicks aren't my thing, so I try to keep that away from my personal site.
- Make it a Wordpress alternative. Hence, it even supports an admin panel powered by Forestry.io!

So, if the aforementioned points matters to you, then fo ahead & check out how to get your own blog which looks similar to mine.

### :running: The Easy & Quick Way To Get It Done

In a hurry to get your personal website running ASAP, then check out the following section.

#### :nut_and_bolt: Setup a Development Environment

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone your copy of the repository locally using the command `git clone git@github.com:<INSERT_YOUR_USERNAME_HERE>/blog.git`.
3. Remove the files under the directory `content`. Note, the files are written in [Markdown][Markdown Guide]. So, if you've been active on GitHub for a while, writing your `.md` content will be a breeze.
4. Ensure you've Hugo installed & is available on PATH. If not, then follow the instructions available in [the official documentation][Install Hugo] to set it up on your local machine.
5. Clone the [PaperMod theme][Hugo-PaperMod] under the `./theme/` directory with the `git submodule add https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod.git` command.
6. `cd` back into the root directory & run the `hugo server` command on your preferred terminal & see if everything works as expected.

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Setting Up Traffic Tracking & Analytics

The blog uses Cloudflare's tracker along with Google Analytics (GA). Thus, privacy-concerned users can either use [uBlock Origin][uBlock Origin] to block tracking JS code or block trackers & cookies from the browser. Using both of them in tandem also helps keep a check on certain inconsistencies ([_source_][Cloudflare vs Google Analytics]).

That said, following are the instructions to setup Cloudflare (and/or GA):

##### Cloudflare

- Create a [Cloudflare][Cloudflare Landing Page] account (_if you don't have one already_).
- Create the tracking JS snippet on the [Analytics dashboard][Cloudflare Analytics Dashboard].
- Copy & replace the existing snippet in [`layouts/partials/extend_head.html`](./layouts/partials/extend_head.html) with the snippet you just created on the Cloudflare Analytics dashboard.

##### Google Analytics

- Create a [Google Analytics][Google Analytics] if you don't own one already!
- Create the [Google Analytics 4 property][Tracking Code Setup Instructions] for the website.
- Add the tracking code (which looks something like `G-XXXXXXXXX`) in the `config.yml` to the `GoogleAnalyticsID` key.
- Add the `gtag.js` snippet to `extend_head.html` partial under `layouts/partials`.

  ```javascript
  <!-- Global site tag (gtag.js)-->
  <script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id={{ .Site.Params.GoogleAnalyticsID}}"></script>
  <script>
    window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
    function gtag() { dataLayer.push(arguments); }
    gtag('js', new Date());

    gtag('config', '{{ .Site.Params.GoogleAnalyticsID}}');
  </script>
  <!-- End of Global site tag (gtag.js)-->
  ```

- Check your GA dashboard with tracking cookies & JS enabled on your browser.

And you're good to go!

But in case, you've privacy concerns on using GA, refer to the [Privacy Policy][Privacy Policy] document for a detailed description of how we use the data gathered through the trackers.

**NOTE**: As of Hugo 0.80, the new Google Analytics 4 [doesn't work][GA 4 Doesn't Work] out-of-the-box with Hugo's internal templates.

#### :control_knobs: Setup a CMS

**Note**: I'm in favour of using [Forestry.io][Forestry]'s service right now over [Netlify CMS][Netlify CMS Landing Page]. It's much more easier & intuitive (_and less buggier too_) to setup. The decision was made after coming across a blocker as documented in [#40][Issue #40]. Since, the devs of Netlify haven't shown any interest to fix the issue, Forestry is a better choice.

For a detailed installation process, refer to the official Forestry.io [documentations][Forestry Docs]. The devs did an amazing job articultating the exact procedure to set it up.

That said, following are the advantages of get setting up a CMS admin panel on the site:

- You no longer need a Markdown Editor (or even the development environment) installed locally. Just access it at: `https://<YOUR-SITE>/admin` & start writing.
- You can give editorial access to 2 more writers all for free. More than that you would've to purchase a subsciption.
- Forestry leverages the Git-backend to update any config files it needs for the CMS, on your behalf. All you got to do is tweak the settings on it's web-based GUI.
- And finally, the main reason for switching from Netlify CMS to Forestry, availability of remote media storage. As of the now the site is configured to load up the image assets off of [Cloudinary][Cloudinary] but other options include [S3][AWS S3] & [Netlify Large Media][Netlify Large Media]. These options should help me in case I need to scale up my image storage capabilities.

There's more information available on the official docs, so do check it out. They did a convincing job to make me switch.

#### :dash: Preparing Your Site For Deployment

1. Write your articles inside the `./content` directory & save them as `.md` files. Check if the articles are generated as expected by running the `hugo server` command.
2. Push your changes to GitHub with the `git push` command from the root directory.
3. Create/login into an account on [Netlify][Netlify Landing Page].
4. Refer to the [Netlify Documentations][Netlify Docs] to setup an initial deployment. You'll have to do it only once if you want to deploy your changes with GitHub Actions instead just like me.
5. Once the site is deployed, Netlify assigns a domain automatically. It should look something on these lines: `https://<NETLIFY_GENERATED_ALPHANUMERIC_STRING>.netlify.app`.

#### :gear: Setup GitHub Actions to Deploy

While you could push your changes to GitHub & Netlify will still trigger a build on their platform, but it's pretty inefficient & non-scalable. Reasons being:

- Netlify has a limited 300 minutes compared to GitHub's insane 2000 minutes of build times. While it should suffice if you've just one site but you can chew through your quoate pretty quick once you start deploying more sites.
- Hugo is fast (_or rather the fastest SSG out there_). It'll generate your static files in under 1ms. Couple it with a fast Action, you can deploy the generated files to Netlify's CDN in less than half a min! This comes handy when you're committing changes constantly & would like to preview a live version of the changes. Doing the same takes at least a min on Netlify's servers.
- It's a more configurable way to deploy the contents.

And the list goes on. There really is no reason why shouldn't use GitHub Actions to deploy your site to Netlify (_if you can, that is_).

So without further ado, let's setup GitHub Actions to build & deploy the site to Netlify (_finally!_ 😤)

- The [nwtgck/actions-netlify][Netlify Actions] is used to manage the build & deployment process. If you had followed the steps till now, you might notice on the GitHub Action's tab that it failed (_which is expected_). To fix it you'll need an Netlify Auth Token & the Site ID.
- You can find the Netlify Auth Token under the [User Settings>Applications][Netlify User Settings] tab. While the Site ID can be found under the individual site's settings at: `https://app.netlify.com/sites/<YOUR-SITE-NAME>/settings/general`. The alphanumeric name under `API ID` is what you should be looking out for.
- Copy those details & save them as [Encrypted Secrets][GitHub Encrypted Secrets]. Make sure to name them as `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` & `NETLIFY_SITE_ID` respectively for the Auth token & the Site ID.

And you're good to go! Write an article under the `./content` directory & push them to the remote respository. Then watch your workflow build & deploy the site all under half a minute! 🤯

## :hammer_and_wrench: Built With

The site is built using Hugo to generate static content. These contents are then deployed to Netlify to be delivered over Netlify's CDN. These are the primary 2 tools you will specifically need to build the website.

For more information on how to use these tools, refer to their respective documentations:

- [Netlify][Netlify Docs]
- [Hugo][Hugo Docs]
- [hugo-PaperMod][Hugo-PaperMod] theme
