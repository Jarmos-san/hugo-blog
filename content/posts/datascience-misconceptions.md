Around 4 years ago, it was this specific video — MarI/O — Machine Learning for
Video Games on YouTube which piqued my interest in Artificial Intelligence &
Machine Learning. Being an avid gamer as well as also having an academic
background in Economics, I thought to myself, “_Oh I already have half of the
skills required to make Mario do stuff like this on his own_”.

You see, that was the first misconception I had about Machine Learning (or Data
Science in general). Little did I know what Reinforcement Learning was, where &
how it was used. But did I care? Nope. All I thought about was creating my own
_ML model_.

The lesson here? Misconceptions arise due to half-baked knowledge & lack of
curiosity to dig further into the rabbit hole. [1]

Regardless, I taught myself to code & now I provide my expertise in Computer
Vision & ML to my clients.

## What Can You Expect From This Article

Looking at recent trends, AI is definitely on the rise. It would be unwise for
anyone to lose out on the abundant employment opportunities at the moment.
Luckily, it’s easier now, then ever was, to dive into the field of Machine
Learning or Data Science. With the thousands of online resources available right
now, it’s easier to learn ML all by yourself.

But with ease of access to learning resources comes a major caveat.

You learned to code, you just figured out what an SVM is & how to tune its
hyper-parameters to achieve great results. All good & dandy, but now ask
yourself. Do you’ve any clue on how to implement your newfound knowledge &
skills into real-world problems?

If you’re dumbfounded with the lack of an answer to the question, well then,
give the rest of the article a quick read.

Through this article, I hope to clear up certain misconceptions you might’ve
before you dive into the field of Machine Learning.

## Watch & Learn From the Humble Giants

Andrew Ng & Jeremy Howard, two of the pioneers in the field of Machine Learning,
have been humble enough to share their knowledge without any monetary
compensation in return. Their motive behind doing so? Just to make the world a
better place by helping the community thrive & enabling them to be more
employable sometime in the near future.

Years ago when I wrote my first print(“_Hello World_”) statement on Python,
their resources were invaluable for me to build the basic foundation of the
aspirations I’ve right now. But was it enough to be actually employable in the
industry?

Not at all.

The nature of online learning resources out there like boot-camps, MOOC, video
tutorials, etc is, they’re marketed to “_Teach Yourself To Code_”. True to their
words, that’s exactly what you invest your time & money in. You learn to code,
not understand the why-to-code in a very specific manner or style.

This creates a problem of its own; The students following the courses mentioned
above take it hoping it would be _enough_ to land a job in real life. But if
that was the case, the 3M+ of students who take an Udemy course alone would be
more than enough to fill up the vacant ML jobs in the industry.

So, obviously, MOOC or other self-paced online courses willn’t cut the thread
for you.

Here’s why.

## The Pitfalls of Democratizing Machine Learning Educational Resources

The field of Machine Learning or Data Science, in general, is dominated by
academicians primarily. The trend appears to be changing gradually for the
better due to certain academicians who’re willing to part with their knowledge
for the community.

This philanthropic approach of the individuals enabled hundreds of thousands of
individuals around the globe to seek employment opportunities in the field.
Besides, we can also see how fast the field is advancing just because they
decided to share their knowledge with the rest of the world.

Put simply, democratizing is good for the community as a whole.

But “_Democratize Data Science & Machine Learning_” is a buzz right now anyway.
Everyone wants to create a tutorial or two for the community. So why did I point
it out specifically, you might wonder to yourself?

Well because I want the community to not be misguided.

To reiterate the statement, let me give you an example of a real-life incident
as described by another writer,
[Rahul Agarwal](https://medium.com/u/e8cce06956c9?source=post_page-----28fcbedf2811----------------------).

Rahul Agarwal, in his article —
[Don’t Democratize Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/dont-democratize-data-science-bd638c4e7957),
stated an instance of an interview where the candidate was experienced & was
perhaps self-taught too. [2]

Quoting from his article;

> _…He explained the higher-level concepts well enough that I decided to dig a
> little deeper into his mathematical understanding of the techniques he had
> applied in his projects. And that was where things changed…_

His account of the interview is a prime example of an individual who relied
solely on just skimming through tutorials, creating projects one after the other
& building a sound portfolio. Suffice to say, just learning _how to code_ isn’t
going to take you far enough.

What can we learn from this context?

You might be an all-star programmer but if you fail to understand basic
underlying concepts, you won’t progress far enough to be employable.

Why is it so?

You see, _most businesses often operate on a shoestring_. Besides, production
environments are volatile, susceptible to not just the market competition but
the whims of the consumers as well. This makes businesses to be in an
unfavourable position & forced to pay attention to the tiniest bit of details in
the product.

From speeding up the data pipeline to making inferences in milliseconds can be a
matter of making a huge profit or going bankrupt. To have an eagle eye for such
precision is what Rahul tried to convey through his article.

## But You Don’t Always Have To Have an Eagle Eye

Contrary to Rahul’s opinion, yet another expert in the field of Machine Learning
& an entrepreneur is
[Caleb Kaiser](https://medium.com/u/ae1782e046c3?source=post_page-----28fcbedf2811----------------------).
He is an advocate of making ML software available to those who need it gravely,
_especially developers who’re not Data Scientists_. His article —
[Deep Learning Isn’t Hard Anymore](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-isnt-hard-anymore-26db0d4749d7)
is a wonderful report in the field of production capable ML software.

In context to this write-up, quoting an excerpt from his article;

> _…people within the community develop libraries and projects that abstract
> common utilities away until the tooling is capable and stable enough to be
> used in production._
>
>     *At this stage, the engineers using it to build software are not concerned about sending HTTP requests or connecting to databases — all of that is abstracted away — and are solely focused on building their product.* [3]

The key phrase here — “_all of that is abstracted away_”.

Now as an entrepreneur, he’s obligated to answer not just to his employees but
his financial backers about the product. Him, trying to figure out the
underlying concepts of the inner working of a product could be a waste of time.
Besides, considering his position in the company, him spending time learning
something new unrelated to his business is money lost for the company. Instead,
he could just hire someone else, an expert in the craft, to do it instead.

My point being, it’s fine if you lack knowledge of the underlying concepts of
Machine Learning if your priorities are, say running a company. But if you’re
looking for employment as an expert in Machine Learning, well you gotta do what
you’re expected to do.

## AutoML Isn’t The Evil Genius, Ready To Take Away Your Job

I really don’t understand the logic behind speaking against automation. Why get
your hands dirty when the job could be automated not just efficiently but saving
time for you to work on something else! Regardless, I guess the history of
protesting against automation goes back in time to when mankind had just started
innovating technology.

![Image of the leader of the Luddites](https://miro.medium.com/max/320/0*iwo8773ijxOSj3dH)

Read up on the Neo Luddism movement, started by an organization named Luddite.
Heck, there’s also a term we use in Economics to refer to the _fear of
technological unemployment_ called the **Luddite Fallacy**.

Speaking more about Luddism would be out-of-context of the article, so that’s a
topic for another day.

Anyway let me direct your attention to Rahul’s article once again, here’s
something that he mentioned which I can’t bring myself to agree with.

>     *…The availability of such packages has led a lot of people to think that data science could be fully automated, eliminating the need for data scientists altogether. Or, if the processes can’t be automated, these tools will allow anyone to become a data scientist*. [1]

I believe he’s concerned about the advent of AutoML software like MindsDB which
is completely baseless.

MindsDB is an amazing piece of open-source AutoML software though, check them
out.

The misconception of anyone being able to create Neural Nets using AutoML
software arose after Sundar Pichai announced Google’s new invention to the
global audience. In his pitch, he stated AutoML would enable our community to
create & design Neural Nets which was previously a skill held by only a few with
a Ph.D.

And I quote him;

> _Today, designing neural nets is extremely time-intensive, and requires an
> expertise that limits its use to a smaller community of scientists and
> engineers. That’s why we’ve created an approach called AutoML, showing that
> it’s possible for neural nets to design neural nets. We hope AutoML will take
> an ability that a few PhDs have today and will make it possible in three to
> five years for hundreds of thousands of developers to design new neural nets
> for their particular needs._ [5]

Did you read where he mentions AutoML is meant for developers? Understand what
that means.

To give an analogy consider I own a company & our app can make your picture look
older using Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs). There’s one position
available to develop my app further. I could hire an individual with a Ph.D. or
an experienced software developer. Sure the Ph.D. holder would’ve got a greater
understanding of how exactly a GAN works underneath. While the developer would
prefer using a framework like Keras to abstract away building the GAN & focus
more on perfecting how the app works.

If I want my company to sustain profitably, should I hire a guy with a Ph.D. or
a developer?

Without a doubt, I would place my bets on the developer to deliver me a
_production-capable product_ on time, considering the constraints I’m under.

Personal opinion aside, abstractions in technology are unavoidable. At some
point in time, repetitive tasks like data augmentations, data cleaning, etc
**NEED** to be abstracted to save up on developer time.

## And Finally, Wrapping Up

The field of Data Science & ML is extremely broad with specific requirements
even within its subfields! There’s no way an individual can become a true master
of Data Science in one lifetime. But fortunately, being a jack of all trades &
master of none in the field of Data Science can be good. You just need to apply
the right skill to the right situation.

We’re living at an amazing point in time.

The advancements made in the field of AI & ML can at times be overwhelming no
doubt. Many of us aspire to make the most out of this opportunity, financially.
You might be just happy with a full-time job while your friend might want to
start his own ML venture. Each of your approaches will definitely be different
as I’ve mentioned previously.

So know what you want to do in the future & figure out the right approach for
your aspirations.

Besides, we should always remind ourselves time-to-time, the benefits such
fast-paced developments have brought to us as a community. Change is good, we
just need to know how to mould ourselves according to the ever-changing
technological environment out there.
