If you ever heard of [Vim][vim] before, you would know all about it's forks that
have popped up in recent years! There‚Äôs [Neovim][neovim] (the most popular
fork), [LunarVim][lunarvim] (one of the most promising fork) & countless others.
And as is obvious, choosing the one right one for yourself can be a difficult
task (been there & done that).

So to help you decide, this article will shed light on some of the reasons to
choose Neovim over Vim. To be more specific, we‚Äôll look into every day use cases
while comparing the two. Analysing everyday use cases is more relevant while
comparing consumer products anyway.

But before we dive into the real deal of the article, as usual a little bit of a
history lesson first.

Vim itself started out as an improved clone of the now antiquated [Vi][vi] by
[Bram Moolenaar][bram moolenaar] way back in the early 90s. Moolenaar himself
overlooked the development & course of actions for Vim. Over the decades, the
Vim source code is starting to become archaic & hard to maintain. It's bloated,
some of the code is unoptimized & it's current set of features hasn't aged well
either.

But, Neovim was rebuilt from scratch! Redundant & decades old code was weeded
out. And all the while the maintainers tried to provide the same power to the
users as Vim did. Although, it did come pre-packaged with ‚Äú_optional steroids_‚Äù
to consume. More on it in the rest of the article!

With that said, let‚Äôs dive deeper & check out why you should use Neovim over Vim
today. Take due note though, this article isn‚Äôt intended as a jibe at Vim or
it‚Äôs loyal users. Rather we‚Äôll try to analyse the differing features of the two
editors & see how useful they are on a day-to-day basis.

## Why is Neovim More Popular Than Vim

As mentioned earlier Vim is pretty old, as such it‚Äôs source code is archaic &
difficult to maintain. And this was a primary reason for the current dev team
for Neovim to fork Vim & set off on a journey of their own.

Unlike some of the rumours floating around Neovim wasn‚Äôt forked because ‚Äú_Bram
is a dictator_‚Äù & what not. Neither was Neovim created to give more power to the
community. But the latter is definitely an unintentional outcome of the fork in
a good way.

Since, Neovim was rebuilt from the ground-up, it opened up doors to;

1. Adding useful features like [Language-Server Protocol][lsp] (LSP), an
   embedded [Lua 5.1][lua] (and LuaJIT) runtime & so on, more easily.
2. Cleaner & optimized source code for easier maintainability & reduced load
   times.
3. Straight-up better plugin development environment.
4. Extending core Neovim capabilities through improved plugins if necessary.

And those were only a few good outcomes of forking the Vim source code. But in
reality, the list is never-ending & chances are, as Neovim matures over time,
there‚Äôll be another reason to extend the list.

Some other equally prominent features include:

1. The underlying Neovim API for plugin devs to use for building pretty much
   anything.
2. The optional embedded Lua 5.1 environment is also a reason why Neovim is so
   loved by the community. If a user wishes to do, Neovim can be configured with
   Lua rather than VimScript.
3. An inbuilt standard library which includes useful functions like
   `CheckHealth` and/or the global `vim` Object. These are used to check if a
   plugin has been set up correctly. Or to configure global Neovim settings.
4. Comes pre-packaged with sensible default settings making the "_Vim
   experience_" more pleasant.

And if it‚Äôs not obvious already, Neovim is already miles ahead when it comes to
useful features. For example, choosing to configure Neovim with either VimScript
or Lua. Or heck if you desire, you can even use both side-by-side, the choice is
all yours!

With Vim, you would be stuck with the dreaded VimScript! While LSP capabilities
are supported through plugins, the experience isn't as smooth & out-of-the-box
like it's cousin.

With that said, let‚Äôs take a more detailed approach to some of the most used
features mentioned above.

## Neovim is Noticeably FASTER Than Vim

As mentioned earlier, one of the major reasons to fork Vim was it‚Äôs archaic
source code. Since Vim has been in existence for close to three decades it's
source code is pretty bloated by now. It was hard to maintain & was much easier
to simply rebuild from scratch, so the devs did what was necessary.

Owing to that decision, the source code was cleaned & optimized. This is obvious
if you notice how faster Neovim is than its predecessor.

Rebuilding Neovim also opened up many doors towards developing handy features.
One & the most killer feature of the editor is the embedded Lua 5.1 (_and
LuaJIT_) environment.

The devs also took other performance optimization course of action as well. One
of them included making Neovim run in an [Event Loop][event loop]. So, you can
finally bid goodbye to plugins that would hang earlier!

Besides that, the devs have also ensured backwards compatibility with VimScript.
So, if you‚Äôre a long-term Vim user who wants to try out Neovim, don‚Äôt fret,
you'll be fine. You can configure Neovim to read your older `.vimrc` just fine
albeit with some trivial hacks here & there.

But what if you‚Äôre committed to using Neovim & are ready to take the dive? Then
I would suggest migrating your current VimScript configurations to Lua code
instead. You‚Äôll notice an increased performance boost.

To give an idea of what sorts of performance boost I‚Äôm talking about here, I'll
share my experience. My Neovim load times decreased from 500+ ms to 237 ms.
That‚Äôs a roughly ~50% improvement by simply migrating from VimScript to Lua!

One can only imagine how much faster it can perform if the config loading
process was optimized even further.

On the flip side though, configuring through Lua is an optional feature. So, you
needn't feel obligated to "_learn yet another language_". More on it in the next
section of the article.

## Option to Ditch VimScript & Embrace Lua

[One of the goals][about neovim] of the Neovim team is to ‚Äú_develop first-class
Lua/LuaJIT scripting alternative to VimL_‚Äù. Staying true to their words, the
devs haven‚Äôt enforced ditching VimScript in favour of Lua. And I doubt any of us
would live to see that happen in our lifetime!

So, if you want to continue using your previous Vim configs, you needn‚Äôt fret at
all. But what if you definitely need Lua code, for example say configuring the
builtin LSP?

For situations like that, Vim `heredoc` will be at your rescue. You can embed
Lua code within VimScript with a syntax which looks something like this;

```vim
Lua << EOF
require'lspconfig'.pyright.setup{
  cmd = { "pyright-langserver", "--stdio" }
  filetypes = { "python" }
  root_dir = function(filename)
        return util.root_pattern(unpack(root_files))(filename) or util.path.dirname(filename)
      end,
  settings = {
    python = {
      analysis = {
        autoSearchPaths = true,
        diagnosticMode = "workspace",
        useLibraryCodeForTypes = true
      }
    }
  }
}
EOF
```

And you‚Äôre good to go out on your day without worrying it would break something
from your previous Vim configs. Vim would still know how to parse those code &
make sense of it.

Although, a bit of a personal opinion here, try not to use VimScript if you can.
Coding in Lua is a much pleasant experience. And even if you had to learn it,
the language has many real-life applications outside of a Vim environment. So,
it‚Äôs not like you would be wasting your time learning a redundant programming
language. If you do decide to start configuring Neovim with Lua, do give this
‚Äú[Guide to Using Neovim with Lua][neovim lua guide]‚Äù a thorough read.

That said, Neovim‚Äôs embedded Lua environment‚Äôs usefulness takes proper shape
through it‚Äôs inbuilt standard library & API. If you‚Äôre either a plugin developer
or a regular Vim user, the standard library can be useful in many ways. It
packages many useful functions & commands to use for your day-to-day development
needs.

So, in the next section, we'll take a more detailed look into it.

## The Inbuilt Standard Library & the API is üíñ

Second on Neovim's list of development goals is to create a suitable environment
of plugin authors. That way, the plugin authors could extend the core features
of Neovim with much ease. And the core team of devs achieved this feat by
creating the Neovim API layer & an accompanying "_standard library_".

The underlying API layer exposes useful functions to the user for programmatic
control over Neovim. These functions are exposed through a global namespace
called `vim`.

As such, let's say we want to configure Neovim to display the number column.
Then it's as easy as writing `vim.api.nvim_set_option(‚Äúnumber‚Äù, true)` in an
`init.lua` (_or `init.vim` with some caveats_) file. And you're good to go!

Granted, a first glance on the global `vim` namespace might look confusing but
stay with me & I‚Äôll help you make sense of it.

The `vim` namespace exposes a couple functions for everyday use. Most notable
ones include the `vim.api`, `vim.lsp` & `vim.inspect` functions. There are a
couple more of them & explaining all them is out-of-scope for this article. But,
you can find a comprehensive list of these functions detailed in the "_`vim`
namespace section_" of the [Lua for Neovim
guide][nanotree lua guide for neovim].

To stay relevant to the context of this article, following are some of the most
useful functions exposed by the `vim.api` namespace:

1. Functions for setting options like `vim.api.nvim_set_option()`. Or the
   `vim.api.nvim_get_option()` for getting the value of a global option. On
   similar lines, there are functions for Buffer-local and/or Window-local
   functions. These functions look like `vim.api.nvim_buf_set_option()` &
   `vim.api.nvim_win_set_option()` respectively.

2. The ‚Äú_Vim experience_‚Äù is pretty much incomplete without customizing
   personalized key bindings. And , there‚Äôs a pretty nifty function for doing
   exactly that as well! The `vim.api.nvim_set_keymap()` function takes four
   parameters. The ‚Äú_mode_‚Äù, your custom key binds, the expression/default key
   binds & options (_like ‚Äúsilent‚Äù_) to pass to it.

3. Another function I found useful on a day-to-day basis is the
   `vim.api.replace_termcodes()`. It's used for escaping terminal & Vim
   keycodes. Since VimScript does it by default, you never have to worry about
   escaping stuff like `‚Äù\<C-n>‚Äù` times. But this doesn‚Äôt work as expected when
   configuring through Lua code. Hence, this function can be pretty handy at
   times.

There‚Äôre many more of such functions & we barely scratched the surface of what‚Äôs
possible! For more information on the `vim` namespace, refer to the ‚Äú_Lua for
Neovim guide_‚Äù mentioned above. The official documentation at `h: api` is also
quite handy for finding more info on the functions, the `vim.api` namespace
exposes.

With all that power in your hands, the sky's pretty much the limit to extending
Neovim further than it‚Äôs core features. So, go figure it out yourself & don‚Äôt
hesitate sharing them with the Neo(Vim)community.

## Sensible Default Settings for a Better First-Time Experience

If programmatic configurations of your editor don't sound interesting to you. Or
perhaps, you tried out Vim some time earlier & found it difficult to use? Or
maybe you didn‚Äôt want to spend a whole weekend trying to configure Vim for your
specific needs? Well for you, my friend, there's good news. Reducing the
barrier-to-entry for first-time Vim users topped the development goals for the
Neovim devs.

So, what does it mean for the uninitiated?

It means, Neovim, out-of-the-box looks & feels good enough. It doesn‚Äôt need much
of any configuration & it‚Äôs usable for all your software development needs.
Granted this feature isn't as interesting as Neovim‚Äôs other ‚Äú_killer features_‚Äù
like inbuilt LSP. Or it‚Äôs programmatic config system through the embedded Lua
environment. But it‚Äôs still an important feature worth noting.

When you want an editor that serves your purpose, helps you complete every-day
tasks, you wouldn‚Äôt want to spend a day (or two) configuring it, wouldn‚Äôt you?
And if you‚Äôre someone who fall into this category of people, Neovim is worth a
try. Who knows, you might like it & stick with it for the rest of your dev
career.

## Final Words & Resources for Your Journey into Neovim-land

And now, before I answer the question, ‚Äú_Vim or Neovim: Which one to use?_‚Äù.
Here's a short summary of everything we talked about earlier:

1. Why does Neovim exist in the first place? And how it affected the community.

2. We now know, Neovim‚Äôs source code was cleaned, optimized & rewritten from
   scratch. Hence, it‚Äôs noticeably faster than it‚Äôs older cousin Vim.

3. Allowing Neovim to be rewritten opened up opportunities to include many
   useful features like LSP, asynchronous execution, etc.

4. Inclusion of a ‚Äú_standard library_‚Äù which augments the optional embedded Lua
   environment for configurability. Sensible default configurations to ease a
   first-time Vim user‚Äôs experience.

...and many more! The list is never-ending & what I listed up there is just the
cherry on top of the cake. These features are also what makes Neovim stand out
when compared to Vim. But, it shouldn‚Äôt come as a surprise if Vim supports most
if not all of Neovim‚Äôs features one day as well.

That said, you should use Neovim for reasons mentioned below:

1. You need a terminal-based editor with stable cross-platform availability.

2. You‚Äôve been a long-time Vim user & find certain features of the editor like
   VimScript annoying & frustrating.

3. You need modern IDE-like features like LSP support out-of-the-box and/or if
   you need some default configurations available without further tinkering.

4. And finally, if you need a minimalist text editor which is modern, Neovim
   should be your go-to option.

Do you believe those were some valid reasons to try out Neovim, let me know what
you think!
