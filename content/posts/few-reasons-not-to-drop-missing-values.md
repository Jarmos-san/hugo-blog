A series of Missing Values can often stand out like a blotch on a series of
structured data.

Look at the picture above. The first thing that you might’ve subconsciously
observed is that there’s a stroller missing. Indeed, let me break it to you,
that’s exactly how the human brain works.

Guess what? While working with Real-World Data, you will seldom come across a
dataset devoid of Missing Values!

Like a blotch on a piece of paper Missing Values stand out like an eyesore.

Those white patches in between satisfyingly clean & straight columns, damn,
shoot me if I said they don’t trigger my OCD.

Unfortunately, for us, Data Analysts, dealing with noisy data IS half of our day
job &, I’ll be honest, to make our lives easier, I’m often tempted to just drop
the rows with Missing Values! But doing that wouldn’t be wise as it could lead
to a loss of information and/or allow some degree of bias to creep in too which
is a topic for discussion on another blog. So if interested, continue reading
till the end.

## Returning Back to the Discussion About Missing Values

You shouldn’t be surprised but Data Analysts are, actually, always on the
offensive to deal with missing values in a dataset. In fact, more often than
not, Missing Values actually represent major bits & pieces of information,
albeit one that might/mightn’t differ from what the rest of the complete data
says!

As such it’s absolutely necessary to ascertain assumptions about the missing
values, which are:

1. Are the data “Missing Completely At Random (MCAR)”?
2. Or are they “Missing At Random (MAR)”?
3. And finally if they are “Missing Not At Random (MNAR)”?

For example, if the likelihood for men to disclose their age & weight is higher
than women, the resulting collection of data would have a series of Missing
Values and they will be considered Missing Not At Random (MNAR). Hence,
appropriate steps can be taken to deal with imputing the missing variables for
further analysis.

On a side note though, with an open mind, Missing Values should rather be
analyzed similarly to the rest of the remaining complete data set. In fact,
recent academic research suggests that inconsistencies are more visually
perceptive than traditional statistical inferences.

## Our Visual Perception Towards Inconsistencies

An example of how visualizing Missing Values help us get a better understanding
of the data set is showcased through the image of a MissingNo matrix above.

A quick glance at the image and one can see that the “scheme_name” column has a
significant amount of values missing. And what could possibly be the reason for
such discrepancy?

Well, the dataset in context to that MissingNo Matrix image above is a
compilation of information from various sources on Community Water Pumps
scattered all over the country of Tanzania and it appears that some of those
pumps could’ve been installed by an NGO or a Non-Profit Organization or possibly
some considerate individuals. Hence, the maintenance of the pumps do not fall
under the jurisdiction of any Government Scheme in Tanzania. Thus it can be
safely assumed that the data is MNAR.

Quoting a statement from a recent research publication on visual perception of
inconsistent series data, should further strengthen my claim about the reason
behind having an open-mindedness towards handling Missing Values.

Their proposition is that people, in general, are MORE PERCEPTIVE towards
inconsistency especially through a visual format that depicts some information
to them.

In other words, just like the picture above at the top which subconsciously
enforced you to zoom in towards the spot where a baby stroller was supposed to
be present, the Human Brain makes a certain set of plausible assumptions through
Visual Perception. Hence, it’s safe to assume a common knowledge that, we as
humans, instinctively perceive more information visually rather than any other
forms of inference.

The authors of the aforementioned publication further go on to say, that human
beings do not receive vague visuals with inconsistency in a good light. Rather,
it’s preferable and even highly advisable to annotate or provide meaning to the
missing data when/if applicable.

## Conclusion

To summarize, NaN values doesn’t necessarily mean that quality of the data is
bad but as a Data Analyst, it’s a responsibility to be wary of the reason for
the existence of such discrepancy in the data before dealing with them properly.
