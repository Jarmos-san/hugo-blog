Heard of the new Windows Terminal (WT), Microsoft has been actively working on
recently? You might‚Äôve if you‚Äôve been following my updates on Twitter. I was
advocating Microsoft‚Äôs effort to make Windows a more developer-friendly platform
for quite a while now. And ever since I moved from Ubuntu to Windows for my
coding needs, I‚Äôve come to realise how things have changed on Windows-land for
the better.

## What is This New Windows Terminal?

With that said, WT is a console developed & distributed by Microsoft. It
supports a wide variety of shells, the full list of which I‚Äôm not aware of. But
I‚Äôm assured it supports most of the popular ones. Hence, by popularity, Bash/zsh
is supported through Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) & PowerShell 5.1 which
ships pre-packaged with Windows 10.

On that note, I‚Äôve been using PowerShell 5.1 mainly because it‚Äôs there by
default & is a much easier scripting language over Bash. So, without further
ado, let‚Äôs dive into how I‚Äôve made some very minimalist customization to WT.

## Why Maintain a Minimalist Look?

Windows Terminal is **VERY** customizable, as you‚Äôll see soon enough. You can
set a background image (or a GIF) of your choice. You can add multiple panes to
a tab with each running a different shell instance, the possibilities are
infinite. But customizing to such an extent comes with a caveat, spending way
more time on customizing the Terminal to look ‚Äúperfect‚Äù is time-consuming. The
time which I could spend on projects & work instead.

Besides, there‚Äôs also the problem of cognitive overload I‚Äôve trouble dealing
with. Thus, I follow the principles of minimalism wherever possible. Put simply,
having just enough & specific information for a task is all I need. If a need
arises, customizing the Terminal to fit those needs is still an open option.

Anyway, enough of my justifications & let‚Äôs cut the chase. This is the
configuration I use, feel free to copy & use them.

Anyway, enough of my justifications & let‚Äôs cut the chase. This is the
configuration I use, feel free to copy & use them.

## My Customization & Description of the Config File

The Windows Terminal configurations are divided into 4 distinct sections each
customizing a specific aspect of the software.

**Global (or Default) Settings**:

The config file begins with the Global (or ‚Äú_default_‚Äù) settings. Followed by
the Profile, Colour Schemes & lastly, the key Bindings (or ‚Äú_Actions_‚Äù).

Right at the start of the file, the Global settings apply customization to the
whole software, as in how Windows Terminal behaves. In context to that, my
configuration starts Windows Terminal with PowerShell as the default profile
(more on profiles a bit later), indicated with the `defaultProfile` settings.

Right below it & till line 12, I‚Äôve set Windows Terminal to not copy a body of
text when selected & not even the formatting. Azure Shell & WSL profiles are
also disabled since I‚Äôve yet to find any relevant use for them. And at last, to
ensure my eyes don‚Äôt burn & are protected, a dark theme, tab width & startup
window maximized is enabled.

Those were the Global settings which apply to the whole of Windows Terminal as a
software. They don‚Äôt do much but help with the startup time, my eyes &
productivity.

But here‚Äôs where things get visually interesting, customizing individual
Profiles.

**Profiles**:

Profiles are Windows Terminal‚Äôs way of creating & manipulating shells & other
terminal emulators. In other words, you can have a PowerShell session running
side-by-side on a tab with Bash (running on an Ubuntu-WSL). If it isn‚Äôt obvious
from the GIF on the featured image already, I‚Äôve set up four profiles ‚Äì
PowerShell, Python Repl, Git Bash & Neovim. But the configuration lists 6, how &
what‚Äôs going on?

Be patient, soon enough you‚Äôll figure that out as well.

The Profile section accepts some default settings as well. And they‚Äôll be
applied to each of the profiles stated inside the array. The default settings
specify, the starting directory when the profile is initiated, the font size,
bold fonts (so you don‚Äôt have to squint to read the texts), padding (makes the
text look nicer & works like CSS padding), the shape & colour of the cursor (to
add some oomph‚Ä¶). The acrylic background is enabled, making the Terminal look
transparent. And not to forget, at last, the name of the colour scheme.

These default settings ensure uniformity across whichever shell emulator is in
use. These settings also ensure good minimalist aesthetics without being too
distracting and/or hard on the eyes.

Line 25-64 lists the profiles, the crest of Windows Terminal we‚Äôve been
discussing till now. There‚Äôs a lot more you could do here, so I suggest checking
out the
[official docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/customize-settings/profile-settings)
first. You can build upon my configurations & yes, don‚Äôt forget to share your
creations with me (tweet them to me üòâ).

Anyway, keeping in mind a minimalist approach, Command Prompt & Azure profiles
are hidden using the `hidden: true` settings. Since Windows Terminal comes with
them by default & removing them makes the software act weird, I felt it‚Äôs best
to hide them altogether. Besides Azure Shell & Command Prompt, PowerShell is
also configured to load by default right after installation.

And, I‚Äôve been using PowerShell a lot lately & I assure you, it‚Äôs pretty darn
good! It‚Äôs a good scripting language which has the simplicity of Python & file
system management capabilities of Bash. So, I feel you should give it a try,
more so right now, since it‚Äôs cross-platform. Hence, PowerShell is set to
`hidden: false`, to **NOT** hide it from the UI.

Additionally, the `guid` is set to a unique alphanumeric value, generated using
`New-Guid` in PowerShell which acts as a unique identifier for that specific
profile. `name` is set to the name of the profile which should show up on the UI
tab. Often you might‚Äôve to use `suppressApplicationTitle: true` to not load the
application default name. For example, Git Bash loads the file path as the tab
name on the UI.

The `commandline` & icons setting accepts the path to the binaries & the icons,
respectively. If the file path is added to PATH, then there‚Äôs no need to specify
the absolute file path. I did something similar with `nvim`.

A great feature of Windows 10 is the concept of
[Universal Windows Platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/universal-application-platform-guide)
(UWP) app which enables devs to create apps for any Windows platform. Windows
Terminal accesses those UWPs with the `source` setting. Hence, Azure Shell & WSL
are loaded as UWPs on the Terminal.

Now with most of the theory done & dusted, it‚Äôs time to figure out how to
customize the colour scheme & the key bindings. So let‚Äôs move on to the next
section.

**Colour Schemes**:

Lines 65-87 lists the settings for the colour schemes. There‚Äôs not much to
discuss here except perhaps the `name` settings. It serves as an identifier for
specific colour schemes & hence, you can have a list of multiple other colour
schemes, all customized to fit your needs.

Do note though, it‚Äôs important to name your colour schemes, as that‚Äôs what each
profile will refer to for customizing its font colours. But in my case, I‚Äôve set
one single colour scheme for all the profiles. This way I can maintain
consistency across all the Shells.

You can of course have more than one scheme, each referenced by specific
profiles.

**Key Bindings**:

As for customized key bindings, I‚Äôve kept them to the minimal, since the default
ones serve my needs most of the time. Feel free to refer to the docs on
customizing key bindings to check & change them according to your needs.

With that said, here‚Äôs the list of key bindings that I use:

- `ctrl+c` for copying a selected piece of text.
- `ctrl+v` for pasting a piece of text from the clipboard.
- `ctrl+shift+f` to find texts/words on the Terminal.
- `alt+shift+d` to split the pane automatically with the most available space &
  duplicating the active shell.
- `shift+alt+2` to activate the Neovim pane & size it automatically.
- `ctrl+w` to close a tab.
- `ctrl+t` to close all the other tabs except the current one.
- `ctrl+shift+w` closes the active pane.

And that marks the end of my Windows Terminal customization configuration. That
was a lot to read for a supposed minimalist configuration.

## How Can You Give Your Windows Terminal a Personal Touch

My customization was meant to be minimal, pleasant on the eyes & most important,
not distracting. It‚Äôs fine if you find my customization not ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù for
you & thus, would like to add some more personal touches.

To do that, I suggest, looking at the colour scheme customization first. There
are a ton of schemes available for free at
[Windows Terminal Themes](https://windowsterminalthemes.dev/) &
[Terminal Splash](https://terminalsplash.com/). Just ensure there's enough
contrast between the foreground & the font colours. Additionally, you might‚Äôve
to experiment with the acrylic opacity as well & or the background image (or a
.gif) size, its relative position, etc, if you do add one.

Besides the colour customizations, you could try customizing the shell prompts.
The GIF image above, showcases my custom PowerShell prompt powered by
[oh-my-posh v3](https://ohmyposh.dev/). You could customize Neovim even further
to fit your needs.

Regardless, customizing the PowerShell prompt & setting up Neovim is a project
on its own, hence they deserve a separate blog post of their own.

## What‚Äôre You Waiting For, Start Customizing Yours Too?

That said, I can‚Äôt recommend using Windows Terminal enough. Heck, I would even
go as far as asking you to switch to using Windows as your everyday development
platform. The team behind the development of Windows Terminal at Microsoft are
very proactive. And their contributions are only improving the product each day.
So if you‚Äôre on Window, & haven‚Äôt used Windows Terminal yet, then do it ASAP!

You can download the preview version to test experimental features. They‚Äôre
available both from the
[Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/p/windows-terminal-preview/9n8g5rfz9xk3?activetab=pivot:overviewtab)
or from their [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/releases)
page. Or the non-preview version which serves your purpose.

Once downloaded edit the config file by following the steps mentioned above. And
you‚Äôre good to go! Do let me know how you‚Äôve customized your Terminal. Drop me a
tweet & don‚Äôt forget to share the config file for others to take inspiration
from.

work-in-progress article on customizing PowerShell the prompt. I‚Äôll also share
more details on how I set it up along with Neovim on my Windows machine. So, if
you want to read that as well, then subscribe to my newsletter or follow me on
