Neo(Vim)'s usefulness becomes more apparent with how easy it is define any sort of custom key bindings. Seasoned Vim users are pretty aware of that fact & knows the fact how one can achieve quite a lot with just custom keybindings alone. And with Neovim v0.5+ the community was introduced to the optional Lua runtime as well. Which brought about even more power to the user than ever. With an actual programming language at the user's disposal, what's possible to do using Neovim key bindings is now limited only by the user's imagination & capabilities.
