Neo(Vim)'s usefulness becomes more apparent with how easy it is define any sort
of custom key bindings. Seasoned Vim users are pretty aware of that fact & knows
the fact how one can achieve quite a lot with just custom keybindings alone. And
with Neovim v0.5+ the community was introduced to the optional Lua runtime as
well. Which brought about even more power to the user than ever. With an actual
programming language at the user's disposal, what's possible to do using Neovim
key bindings is now limited only by the user's imagination & capabilities.

## Introduce the Optional Lua Runtime

At the time of writing of this article the Neovim devs released `Neovim v0.5`
only a few months ago. And with it came a much anticipated feature, the optional
Lua runtime. Now you no longer had to rely on the cryptic VimScript & migrate
partially or completely to Lua code.

In this article, we won't dive deeper into the differences between configuring
Neovim with Lua and/or with VimScript. But if you want to refresher on that
topic, do check out a previous article -
[Vim or Neovim? Here's Why You Should Use the Latter](../vim-vs-neovim).
Additionally, do refer to the excellent
[Neovim-Lua Guide](https://github.com/nanotee/nvim-lua-guide) on GitHub.
