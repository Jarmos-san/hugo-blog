The day I took a plunge & went full-time freelance, a lingering thought has
bothered me ever since; “How do I make my presence known to my prospective
clients?”.

A quick Google search on the same question helped me come up with the following
quick conclusions:

1. “_Share content out there through blog posts._”
2. “_Be consistent about writing._”
3. “_Maintain a personal blog site._”

Cool! I got the “answers” I was looking for, as I thought & wondered, “how am I
supposed to set up a website that I can call my own?”

Enter Static Site Generators(SSGs) & SSG Hosts like GitHub Pages & Netlify were
the few that I tried, albeit miserably.

So here’s my opinionated documentation of the ordeal I suffered from for the
past year or so while trying to build my own identity on the Internet.

## Choosing the Right SSG

Perhaps I’m wrong about it but as far as I know, SSGs are supposed to ease our
lives. Little did I know, even they come packed in with a slight learning curve.
For example, [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), a React framework promising
developers to build blazing static sites does live up to its expectation but
with a catch!

_Prior knowledge about React Components is a massive added advantage._

Similarly, _Hugo_ & [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) are based on Golang
& Python programming languages, respectively. The former is quite simple & easy
to use, not to forget how the super-fast the build times are but lacks detailed
documentation. This stumbling block was a major setback for me as I did not know
to code on Go.

Hence, without a doubt in mind, I chose Pelican as a supposedly perfect
alternative for building the site as I was already proficient with Python.
Problem solved, I got back to my comfort zone, everything’s fine & dandy or
that’s what I thought it would be.

Heck, if that was the case, I wouldn’t be writing this article, would I?

The major setback of setting up a site using Pelican is its themes, in general.
Don’t get me wrong, the authors of Pelican have detailed everything in the
documentations but the existing themes just lack some lustre. Perhaps, if only
they did focus on improving that aspect of their product, more users would flock
towards using Pelican as their go-to SSG. In fact, it’s the eye-catching &
modern-looking themes that make the other popular SSGs, Gatsby & Hugo, what
they’re among their users.

On a side note though, Pelican does allow customizing the existing themes as
much as I wanted but think about it for a second. Would you compromise your time
& effort in tinkering with front-end web development stuff when your precious
time could be better utilized elsewhere, like running a business?

By now you must be wondering, I should’ve just chosen GitHub Pages in the first
place considering its built-in support for static pages powered by Jekyll. All
that’s required of me was to upload the static pages to a repository & host it
in a _“<username.github.com>”_ subdomain.

Well, I could do that but did you take a look at the list of supported themes?
Check them out at
[GitHub Pages Supported Themes](https://pages.github.com/themes/). Most of them
sport a minimalist look which is pretty satisfactory for “just blogging” which
can be customized to my heart’s content but then again why should I bother?

## What’s the fuss about theming & designs

There’s something called “_Visual Hierarchy_” & it consists of 6 principles.
Bear in mind, I’m no designer by profession so it’s a waste of effort & time, if
I had to customize my themes adhering to the time-tested principles of visual
hierarchy.

But briefly put, the principles states the following:

1. _Reading Patterns_ — Certain optimized ways to get the readers’ short
   attention span.

2. _Just The "**Right**" Font Size_ — Explains how using an optimal font size is
   useful to grab the reader’s attention & make them feel obligated to read
   further.

3. _Space & Texture_ — This is a testament that adequate spacing between lines &
   other content is key to creating modern-looking sites on the Internet today.

4. _Typeface Weight & Pairing_ — Mostly crucial for branding as this is what
   brings about specific characteristic looks & visuals of a brand on the
   Internet.

5. _Color & Tint_ — Humans perceive visual characters more prominently than any
   other beings on the planet. Using the right colour & tint in your themes is
   of utmost importance.

6. _Direction_ — Perhaps the most crucial principle of all is the page layout of
   the site. This is how the writer can make the most out of the reader’s short
   attention span. No single site will have obviously the same page layout as
   the other & each of them is usually optimized according to its audience.

Hence, as you can see those were quite a handful of principles to keep in mind.
By doing so, makes the reader comfortable reading the content. It’s an
obligation a writer has to adhere to strictly.

Designers_, a blog post written by the guys at _99designs_, a read. [1]

## Medium Appears To Be the “Perfect” Alternative

To be honest, no platform is perfect! At least none that I could find till now,
in my opinion, but I’ll have to live with what’s available for now.

Certain aspects of Medium, I dislike are the obligations to share content behind
a paywall to be eligible for curation & publishing the content with major
publishers in order to find more eyeballs on my content. Granted it’s not
enforced on me to necessarily publish an article behind a paywall or with a
publication but let’s face it, if I didn’t, my articles willn’t accumulate
enough readers.

Regardless of Medium’s setbacks, I find the platform still good enough for my
purpose! With built-in SEO tools, a UI, specifically designed keeping in mind
the _Principles of Visual Hierarchy_ & much more. To be honest, asking for more
would be too greedy of me.

Besides, until I came across
[Jason Weiland](https://medium.com/@jasonjamesweiland)’s article —
“[4 Types of Creatives Who Don’t Need a Blog or Website](https://medium.com/better-marketing/4-types-of-creatives-who-dont-need-a-blog-or-website-4b70697d0c41)”,
I was still stuck in the dilemma.

The final nail in the coffin for me was when I read the following line from his
article & I quote.

>     *Do we need to be adding to the noise on an already crowded web?*

Granted, Jason’s article was primarily targeted towards a very specific niche of
creative writers. But advice on improving one’s writing skills, in general, is
all the same, irrespective of one another’s field of expertise.

## Wrapping Up & The Reasons Behind Choosing Medium Over a Personal Blog Site

1. Setting up a personal site doesn’t mean I would find an audience right then
   there. Medium makes my job significantly easier with over 200M total visits
   from around the world to the site(**as of writing this article**).[3]

2. No additional hosting expenses required, neither is there any need to worry
   about “_building_” my site.

3. The built-in SEO tools are way too good to overlook! As of writing this
   article, Alexa ranks the site at 87 in global Internet engagement. [4]

So from a Machine Learning Engineer’s point-of-view Medium appears to be just
the right platform to share his/her ideas and/or content. No more tinkering
around with Dev Ops or Web Dev stuff. I can now put aside the idea of owning my
personal site temporarily & focus on delivering content to my audience first.
Anything else to worry about can be taken care of tomorrow.
