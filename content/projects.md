I contribute to open-source software when I'm not busy or working with clients.
Following is a list of some of my most prominent & beloved side-projects.

## Overview of the Respective Projects

The aforementioned projects are some of my most passionate projects, I created.
Feel free to check out (_or contribute if you want to!_ :wink:).

That said, here's a more comprehensive details of each of those projects:

- **Alokka**: This is an asynchronous wrapper around the latest Twitter API v2
  for Python. My motivation to create Alokka was because back when I created it,
  there was no support for the latest v2 API. Most of the popular Python
  packages for Twitter API were outdated or didn't support v2 for whatever
  reasons. Hence, I decided to start my journey with Alokka. But as of Sept
  2021, the project hasn't received any attention & is unlikely to see any time
  soon. I would love to collaborate on the project though so do let me know if
  it interests you! :heart:
- **Personal Blog**: Blogging is yet another auxiliary skill every developer
  should've on their belt. Hence, I started my blogging journey some two years
  ago with Medium. But Medium's limitation & the fact "_I don't own the
  contents_" I share led to start with my personal blogging platform. I used
  Netlify, Hugo & a lot other technology to set it up & have future plans to
  redo it with further improvements in the near future! Do check out it's
  repository if you're interested in how I blog.
- **dotfiles-windows**: Inspired by Mythias Bynen's
  [dotfiles][mathias-dotfiles], I wanted to backup my dotfiles for my Windows
  machines as well! This work-in-progress holds all the dotfiles I use to
  configure software like [Neovim][neovim], [Git][git], [Windows
  Terminal][windows terminal] & so on. Other goodies included with the dotfiles
  are PowerShell scripts for automating some repetitive & mundance tasks.
- **Niyomok**: Pronounced as _nee-o-mokh_ means "_rules & regulations_" in
  Bengali. With Niyomok, creating a NextJS project from scratch everytimeno
  longer has to be a repetitive task. Create a repository from the template,
  clone the recently created repo locally & you're good to go! You no longer
  have to configure ESLint, Prettier & other stuff from scratch ever again.
- **Jarvim**: While Neovim is rightfully shipped as a minimalistic text editor,
  you're free to configure & extend it as you wish. Which means, it's possible
  to have an extremely lightweight IDE-like experience right within the
  Terminal. But it comes with a compromise, configuring Neovim takes time
  (_possibly a lifetime_) but Jarvim let's you experience that without any
  configurations requirements! It's a one-stop solution, curl the install script
  & let it take care of the rest.
