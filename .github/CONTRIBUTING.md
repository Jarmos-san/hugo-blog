## What should I know before I get started

### My Blog

My blog is an open-source project. When you initially consider contributing to
my blog, you might be unsure about what changes you want to implement without
messing up the functionality of the site. This section should help you with
that.

Here's a list of the big ones:

- **Broken links**
- **UI changes**
- **Faster loading times**
- **Better SEO**

_or something else totally!_

## How Can I Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for my blog. Following
these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report
:pencil:, reproduce the behaviour :computer: :computer:, and find related
reports :mag_right:.

Before creating bug reports, please check
[this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you
don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please
[include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). Fill
out [the required template](./ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.md), the information it
asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing
> that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original
> issue in the body of your new one.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

- Check if the content is being delivered to your browser. Sometimes a quick
  Hard Refresh(**Shift + Ctrl + R**) might resolve the issue.
- Determine if such a bug report has already been reported earlier or not.
- Take a screenshot of the bug if possible & take note of the Browser details.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues][github issue guide]. After you've discovered
the bug, create an issue on that repository & provide the following information
by filling in [the template](./ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.md).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce
the problem:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as
  possible.
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files
  or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those
  examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code
  blocks][markdown code blocks guide].
- **Describe the behaviour you observed after following the steps** and point
  out what exactly is the problem with that behaviour.
- **Explain which behaviour you expected to see instead and why.**
- **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the
  described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. If you use the keyboard
  while following the steps, **record the GIF with this tool**:
  [**Licecap**][licecap landing page] to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and
  [Silent Cast][silent cast] or [Byzanz][byzanz] on Linux.
- **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you
  were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the
  guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

- **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new
  version of Atom) or was this always a problem?
- If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in
  an older version of your preferred browser?** What's the most recent version
  in which the problem doesn't happen?
- **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how
  often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for my
blog, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing
functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community
understand your suggestion :pencil: and find related suggestions :mag_right:.

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check
[this list](#before-submitting-an-enhancement-suggestion) as you might find out
that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an enhancement
suggestion, please
[include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion).
Fill in [the template](./ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md), including the steps
that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion

- **Discuss about it** by openning a [Discussion thread][discussion threads].
- **Check if there's already [an open issue][open issue threads] which provides
  that enhancement.**
- **Perform a [cursory search][enhancement issue threads]** to see if the
  enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the
  existing issue instead of opening a new one.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to my blog? You can start by looking through
these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

- [Beginner issues][beginner issues] - issues which should only require a few
  lines of code, and a test or two.
- [Help wanted issues][help wanted issues] - issues which should be a bit more
  involved than `beginner` issues.

Both issue lists are sorted by the total number of comments. While not perfect,
the number of comments is a reasonable proxy for an impact a given change will
have.

#### Local development

Check out the the [Getting Started][getting started section] on the README to
setup a local development environment.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain my blog's quality.
- Fix problems that are important to the blog's viewers.
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible way to allow my
  viewers to access the site.
- Enable a sustainable system for me to review contributions.

Please follow these steps to have your contribution reviewed:

1. Follow all instructions in [the template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
2. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides)
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status
   checks][github status checks docs] are passing <details><summary>What if the
   status checks are failing?</summary>If a status check is failing, and you
   believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment
   on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. I'll
   re-run the status check for you. If I can conclude that the failure was a
   false positive, then I'll open an issue to track that problem with our status
   check suite.</details>

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull
request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design
work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately
accepted.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move the cursor to..." not "Moves the cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
  - :art: `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
  - :racehorse: `:racehorse:` when improving performance
  - :non-potable_water: `:non-potable_water:` when plugging memory leaks
  - :memo: `:memo:` when writing docs

  - :apple: `:apple:` when fixing something on macOS
  - :checkered_flag: `:checkered_flag:` when fixing something on Windows
  - :bug: `:bug:` when fixing a bug
  - :fire: `:fire:` when removing code or files
  - :green_heart: `:green_heart:` when fixing the CI build
  - :white_check_mark: `:white_check_mark:` when adding tests

## Additional Notes

### Issue and Pull Request Labels

This section lists the labels I use to help me track, manage issues & pull
requests.

[GitHub search][github search docs] makes it easy to use labels for finding
groups of issues or pull requests you're interested in. To help you find issues
and pull requests, each label is listed with search links for finding open items
with that label in the repository. I encourage you to read about [other search
filters][github issues search docs] which will help you write more focused
queries.

The labels are loosely grouped by their purpose, but it's not required that
every issue have a label from every group or that an issue can't have more than
one label from the same group.

Please open an [issue][open an issue thread], if you have suggestions for new
labels, and if you notice some labels are missing, then please open an issue for
that as well.

#### Types Labels for Issue Threads & PRs

You can find all the Issue labels & their descriptions at: [Labels][labels].
They're available both for Issues & PRs.
